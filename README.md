# CODE WEEK 4
For the first submission/check fo the code, the following files are the relevant ones:
- demo_nao_gemini_conversation: this file connects the NAO robot to a Gemini API. By doing this, NAO is able to receive audio and visual input, therefore, conversing with the agent. 
- demo_nao_motion_player: since we are recording different movements/gestures we want the NAO robot to perfrom, the motion_recorder file was modified in order to exclusively replay the motions that we have come up with. 
- negative_reactions and positive_reactions folders contain different reactions recorder by us which NAO will perform throughout the HRI.
